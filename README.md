Problem Statement 

The project aims to analyze website traffic data to understand:
Which pages are performing well or poorly
What factors affect user behavior on the site
How user activity (like bounce rate and exit rate) is related to time spent or other metrics

This helps improve the website by:
Identifying issues with user engagement
Optimizing popular pages
Reducing bounce and exit rates

 1.mporting Libraries
You imported useful Python libraries:

* `pandas`, `numpy`  For handling and analyzing data
* `seaborn`, `matplotlib.pyplot'  For data visualization

2.Loading the Data
You loaded the dataset from a CSV file named  Website\_Analytics.csv

3. Cleaning the Data
You removed unnecessary columns like `PAGE_PATH` and `PAGE_URL`
You checked for missing values using `df.isnull().sum()`

4.to be confirmed in full analysis:
As I haven't seen the rest of the notebook yet, the next steps usually involve:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Graphs and charts to understand traffic patterns
Correlation: Checking how bounce rate, exit rate, and time spent are related
Insights and Recommendations: What can be improved on the website

5.Machine Learning
You built a prediction model using ML. Likely steps:
Selected features: Like Time on Page, Bounce Rate, etc.
Chose a target: Possibly predicting if Exit Rate is high or low
Split data into training and testing sets
Trained a model: xboost and logistic regression
Evaluated model accuracy

6. Insights & Conclusion
Identified what influences high exit/bounce rates
Showed how ML can predict poor page performance
Recommended actions to improve the websit
