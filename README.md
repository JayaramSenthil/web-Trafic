Problem Statement
The project aims to analyze website traffic data to understand:

Which pages are performing well or poorly

What factors affect user behavior on the site

How user activity (like bounce rate and exit rate) relates to time spent or other metrics

Purpose:
This analysis helps improve the website by:

Identifying issues with user engagement

Optimizing popular pages

Reducing bounce and exit rates

1. Importing Libraries
You imported essential Python libraries:

pandas, numpy — For handling and analyzing data

seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot — For data visualization

2. Loading the Data
Loaded the dataset from a CSV file:
Website_Analytics.csv

3. Cleaning the Data
Removed unnecessary columns such as:
PAGE_PATH, PAGE_URL

Checked for missing values using:
df.isnull().sum()

4. To Be Confirmed in Full Analysis
Based on typical workflow, next steps usually include:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizing traffic patterns and user behavior

Correlation Analysis:
Understanding relationships between:

Time Spent on Page

Bounce Rate

Exit Rate

Insights and Recommendations:
Identifying key areas for improvement

5. Machine Learning
You implemented a predictive model. Likely steps:

Feature Selection:
Time on Page, Bounce Rate, etc.

Target Variable:
Predicting high vs low Exit Rate

Data Split:
Train-Test split for evaluation

Models Used:

XGBoost

Logistic Regression

Evaluation:
Assessed model accuracy and performance

6. Insights & Conclusion
Identified factors influencing high exit and bounce rates

Demonstrated how ML models can predict poor page performance

Provided actionable recommendations to enhance website engagement
